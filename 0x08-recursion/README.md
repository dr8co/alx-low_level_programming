# 0x08. C - Recursion

Recursion is the process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly.
A recursive function solves a particular problem by calling a copy of itself
and solving smaller subproblems of the original problems.
More recursive calls can be generated as and when required.

It is essential to know that we should provide a certain case
in order to terminate this recursion process.

This project employs recursive functions for operations.
