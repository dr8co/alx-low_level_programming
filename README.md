## About

This repository contains projects on low-level and system programming using C programming language.
The concepts covered in these projects include but not limited to:

* Compilation
* Pre-processor, header files, macros
* Linting
* Variables, types, operators, expressions, loops, nested loops
* Conditional statements
* Functions
* Debugging
* Pointers, double pointers, function pointers, pointer arithmetic
* Arrays, multidimensional arrays, structures
* Dynamic memory allocation
* Static libraries
* Command-line arguments
* Recursion

_______________________

## Requirements

* Linux environment (**Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** was used for all the projects in this repo).

* All code is compiled using GNU C compiler, `gcc`, with flags `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`

_______________________

## Projects

These projects are written mainly in C.
More about individual projects can be found in their respective READMEs.\
The projects are:

* [0x00. C - Hello, World](./0x00-hello_world/)
* [0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while](./0x01-variables_if_else_while/)
* [0x02. C - Functions, nested loops](./0x02-functions_nested_loops/)
* [0x03. C - Debugging](./0x03-debugging/)
* [0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops](./0x04-more_functions_nested_loops/)
* [0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings](./0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/)
* [0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings](./0x06-pointers_arrays_strings/)
* [0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings](./0x07-pointers_arrays_strings/)
* [0x08. C - Recursion](./0x08-recursion/)
* [0x09. C - Static libraries](./0x09-static_libraries/)
* [0x0A. C - argc, argv](./0x0A-argc_argv/)
* [0x0B. C - malloc, free](./0x0B-malloc_free/)
* [0x0C. C - more malloc, free](./0x0C-more_malloc_free/)
* [0x0D. C - preprocessor](./0x0D-preprocessor/)
* [0x0E. C - structures, typedef](./0x0E-structures_typedef/)
