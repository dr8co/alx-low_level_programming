# 0x18. C - Dynamic Libraries

Unlike static libraries, dynamic libraries consist of separate files containing separate pieces of object code.
These files are dynamically linked together to form a single piece of object code.

Dynamic libraries contain extra information that the
operating system will need to link the library to other programs.

The implication of this is that memory is conserved while using
dynamic libraries since each application or program can access the
dynamic library without needing an individual copy, as would be the
case, if we were using static libraries.

Although dynamic libraries afford the ability to alter source code
without recompiling the entire program, static librariesâ€™ execution
speed at run-time is faster because the object code for the
functions within the library are already in the executable file.
As a result, multiple calls to functions are handled more efficientlythan when using dynamic libraries.
