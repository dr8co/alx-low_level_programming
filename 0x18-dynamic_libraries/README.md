# 0x18. C - Dynamic Libraries

 Unlike static libraries, dynamic libraries consist of separate files containing separate pieces of object code.
 These files are dynamically linked together to form a single piece of object code.

 Dynamic libraries contain extra information that the
 operating system will need to link the library to other programs.
